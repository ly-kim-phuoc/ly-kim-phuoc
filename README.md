- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ly Kim Phuoc.
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently a mechatronic engineering student, trying to implement AI into my workflow.
- 💞️ But I also learn programming online in my free time (I can code in C, Python, Matlab but I hope to learn more!).
